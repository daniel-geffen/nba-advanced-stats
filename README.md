# nba-advanced-stats
A number of short python scripts that deal with NBA stats.

All scripts create an Excel spreadsheet with openpyxl with the data they calculate.

Get Possessions Spreadsheet - calculates various variables for every possession in the 2015-16 NBA regular season.

Matchups - calculates the difference between every player's performance against their playoff matchup team, and against the rest of the league (difference in PIE and Net Rating).

MinuteDiff - calculates the total difference in minutes between the regular season and the playoffs for every team.

Wingspan - retrieves the height and wingspan of every player from www.draftexpress.com and gets their 3 point shooting percentages in their first five seasons in the NBA.

Surprises by Month - calculates the number of surprise wins (a team 5 or more wins below wins) in the last 10 seasons and groups them by month. It saves the data and creates a graph with gaussian KDE.
